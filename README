FUSE
####

[http://fuse.sourceforge.net/|FUSE] (Filesystem in Userspace) is an excellent way to hack up filesystems on various operating systems (it is supported best on Linux and BSD). The [http://search.cpan.org/~DPAVLIN/Fuse/|Fuse] Perl module lets you write filesystems in Perl. Scary, but attractively easy!

I’ve written an extension, Fuse::Util, which provides fall-through methods that can be used to write a FUSE filing system which falls through to the underlying filesystem for some of its methods, and a few filesystems:

   <loop_fs>A simple loopback filesystem.
   <metadata_fs>A loopback filesystem which presents the metadata of each file on the underlying filesystem as a file. A design for a more complex version which copes with directories as well is also given in the file @metadata_fs_ideal@.
   <filter_attr_fs>A filesystem which gives a filtered view of the underlying filesystem according to which objects possess a certain extended attribute. (This could easily be extended to arbitrary predicates.)
